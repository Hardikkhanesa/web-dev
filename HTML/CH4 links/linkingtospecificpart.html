                Victory and defeat are an integral part of life.

                I thank the people of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for giving us the opportunity to serve these states. The BJP Governments in these states worked tirelessly for the welfare of the people.</p>

        <p>A speech preference.FM Jaitley: I think result was certainly not as expected&it's an opprtunity to pause and analyse, for results were not as per expected. In both Chhattisgarh&MP we were in power for 15 yrs&we have done well. I don't think there was aniti-incumbency but fatigue factor does come in</p>
